===How To Configure Microphones===
Considering we have two microphones[8sounds and usb microphone] and a speaker

If manyears is not detected then remove ~/.config/pulse directory
If 8sounds has no output use alsamixer to select 8sounds usb and set all microphone channels to capture mode 

Echo cancellation:
To do echo cancellation with pulseaudio you will need to pair up a microphone with speaker.
Edit /etc/pulse/default.pa file

Add the usb mic to list by:
load-module module-alsa-source device_id=Device source_name="usbmic"

Then pair it with default built in audio jack by:
load-module module-echo-cancel aec_method=speex source_name="usbmic"
==end of edit
Note: -- if you restart pc and sound stops working it means usb mic is not attached
-- do not pair 8sounds mic with speaker
-- source is microphone , sink is speaker
Attach usb mic and then
pulseaudio -k
pulseaudio --start
